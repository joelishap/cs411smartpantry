Welcome to our CS411 Spring 2022 final project! Owners of pantries need a way to keep track of pantry inventory. This project attempts to help solve some common issues faced when it comes to pantries such as excess food waste due to item expiry or an overabundance/shortage of items due to unknown quantites. The Smart Pantry will keep track of current inventory, update inventory according to user input, and notify users when an item is close to it's expiry date.
