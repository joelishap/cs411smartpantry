# CS411 Group 17: Smart Pantry

## Project Description
Welcome to our CS411 Spring 2022 final project! Owners of pantries need a way to keep track of pantry inventory. This project attempts to help solve some common issues faced when it comes to pantries such as excess food waste due to item expiry or an overabundance/shortage of items due to unknown quantites. The Smart Pantry will keep track of current inventory and item expiration dates, as well as update inventory according to user input.

## How to Use
Run the code by running the GUI.java file. Upon running, users will see a pop-up of a simple GUI which will allow for user inputs.

For "Action", users must input either "Add" or "Remove".
For consistency, users must always use the same spelling for "Item Name" and "Item Brand" for the same item.
"Item Price" must be an integer or a double.
"Item Quantity" must be an integer.
"Item Expiration Date" must be in the formatting of "MM/DD/YYYY".
